Currency Converter

This is a real-time currency converter application built using Python's tkinter library for the GUI, requests for making API calls, and matplotlib for plotting charts. It allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another, fetch exchange rates data, reset the input fields, and plot exchange rate charts over time.
